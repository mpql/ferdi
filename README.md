# Preamble

Hey! This is a copy of my local copy of the ferdi repository (from ~2022/04/04), before it got wiped and all the collaborators kicked. You can read the specifics [here](https://github.com/pacstah/ferdium/issues/1) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getferdi/comments/u2qck8/ferdi_is_officially_gone/). I've removed links to download the ferdi app and sponsors and whatnot, but it's here for archival purposes.

Check out [ferdium](https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-app) for a continuation of the project!

> ü§¥üèΩ Hard-fork of [Franz](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz), adding awesome features and removing unwanted ones.

Ferdi is a desktop app that helps you organize how you use your favourite apps by combining them into one application. It is based on Franz - a software already used by thousands of people - with the difference that Ferdi gives you many additional features and doesn't restrict its usage! Furthermore, Ferdi is compatible with your existing Franz account, so you can continue right where you left off. Please find out more about Ferdi and its features on getferdi.com.
